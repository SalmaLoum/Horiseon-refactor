# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

> Module-1 challenge

Following scout rules, I wanted to refactor the existing code to meet my client's standard â€” improving the accessibility features of their site. Web accessibility doesn't just help users who are differently-abled, but also, optimizes the page on search engines.
